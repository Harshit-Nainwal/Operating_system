# üß† Operating System Programs in C

This repository contains a collection of basic operating system (OS) programs written in C. These programs are typically used in operating system labs or for understanding key OS concepts such as scheduling algorithms, memory management, and more.

## üìÇ Programs Included

Below is the list of programs currently available in this repository:

| File Name       | Description                         |
